# ifconfig_call_scheduler

This script schedules API calls to `ifconfig.co` at specific times and generates the results accordingly.

## How to Run
Run the script with timestamps in `HH:MM:SS` format:
```sh
python3 api_call.py "12:05:00,12:10:00"
```

This will schedule API calls at `12:05:00` and `12:10:00`.
